# Ruby Demo
Quick foray into ruby syntax / common use cases to support an application
which "extracts, hosts and visualizes every taxi ride in NYC so that any
resident anywere can access it"

Track notes / research [here, in my Quip doc](https://quip.com/rsFoAR8HRclG/Tyler-Technologies-Ruby-Toy-Project)

## MVP Local Design 
#### (no streaming, demonstrates functionality of pulling, transforming, and displaying data)
- Function to call API
- Function to transform data
- Locally hosted site built w/ Ruby on Rails
- Simple frontend for taxi data

## Deliverables for MVP

- [x] Ruby Tutorial
- [x] Find API
- [x] Function call API
